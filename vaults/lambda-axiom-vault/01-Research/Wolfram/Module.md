Module
A module is a mathematical object in which things can be added together commutatively by multiplying coefficients and in which most of the rules of manipulating vectors hold. A module is abstractly very similar to a vector space, although in modules, coefficients are taken in rings that are much more general algebraic objects than the fields used in vector spaces. A module taking its coefficients in a ring R is called a module over R, or a R-module.

Modules are the basic tool of homological algebra. Examples of modules include the set of integers Z, the cubic lattice in d dimensions Z^d, and the group ring of a group.

Z is a module over itself. It is closed under addition and subtraction (although it is sufficient to require closure under subtraction). Numbers of the form nalpha for n in Z and alpha a fixed integer form a submodule since, for all (n,m) in Z,

 nalpha+/-malpha=(n+/-m)alpha 
and (n+/-m) is still in Z.

Given two integers a and b, the smallest module containing a and b is the module for their greatest common divisor, alpha=GCD(a,b).
