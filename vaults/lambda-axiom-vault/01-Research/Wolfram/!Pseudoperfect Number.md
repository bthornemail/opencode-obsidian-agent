A pseudoperfect number, sometimes also called a semiperfect number (Benkoski 1972, Butske et al. 1999), is a positive integer such as 20=1+4+5+10 which is the sum of some (or all) of its proper divisors. Identifying pseudoperfect numbers is therefore equivalent to solving the subset sum problem.

A pseudoperfect number which is the sum of all its proper divisors is called a perfect number.

The first few pseudoperfect numbers are 6, 12, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 36, 40, ... (OEIS A005835).

Every positive integer n=6k is pseudoperfect since

 6k=k+2k+3k 
and k, 2k, and 3k are all proper divisors of 6k. Every multiple of a pseudoperfect number is pseudoperfect, as are all numbers 2^mp for m>=1 and p a prime between 2^m and 2^(m+1) (Guy 1994, p. 47).

A pseudoperfect number cannot be deficient (or therefore prime). Rare abundant numbers which are not pseudoperfect are called weird numbers.
