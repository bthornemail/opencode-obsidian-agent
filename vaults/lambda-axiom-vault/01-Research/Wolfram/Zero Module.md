Zero Module
Every module over a ring R contains a so-called "zero element" which fulfils the properties suggested by its name with respect to addition,

 0+0=0, 
and with respect to multiplication by any element a of R,

 aÂ·0=0. 
This shows that the set {0} is closed under both module operations, and, therefore, it itself is a module, called the zero module. It also deserves the name trivial module, since it is the simplest module possible.
