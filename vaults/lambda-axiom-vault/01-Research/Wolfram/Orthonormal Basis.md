Orthonormal Basis
A subset {v_1,...,v_k} of a vector space V, with the inner product <,>, is called orthonormal if <v_i,v_j>=0 when i!=j. That is, the vectors are mutually perpendicular. Moreover, they are all required to have length one: <v_i,v_i>=1.

An orthonormal set must be linearly independent, and so it is a vector basis for the space it spans. Such a basis is called an orthonormal basis.

The simplest example of an orthonormal basis is the standard basis e_i for Euclidean space R^n. The vector e_i is the vector with all 0s except for a 1 in the ith coordinate. For example, e_1=(1,0,...,0). A rotation (or flip) through the origin will send an orthonormal set to another orthonormal set. In fact, given any orthonormal basis, there is a rotation, or rotation combined with a flip, which will send the orthonormal basis to the standard basis. These are precisely the transformations which preserve the inner product, and are called orthogonal transformations.

Usually when one needs a basis to do calculations, it is convenient to use an orthonormal basis. For example, the formula for a vector space projection is much simpler with an orthonormal basis. The savings in effort make it worthwhile to find an orthonormal basis before doing such a calculation. Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization is a popular way to find an orthonormal basis.

Another instance when orthonormal bases arise is as a set of eigenvectors for a symmetric matrix. For a general matrix, the set of eigenvectors may not be orthonormal, or even be a basis.
