Torsion
The torsion of a space curve, sometimes also called the "second curvature" (Kreyszig 1991, p. 47), is the rate of change of the curve's osculating plane. The torsion tau is positive for a right-handed curve, and negative for a left-handed curve. A curve with curvature kappa!=0 is planar iff tau=0.

The torsion can be defined by

 tau=-NÂ·B^', 	
(1)
where N is the unit normal vector and B is the unit binormal vector. Written explicitly in terms of a parameterized vector function x,

tau	=	(|x^.x^..x^...|)/(|x^.xx^..|^2)	
(2)
	=	rho^2|x^.x^..x^...|	
(3)
(Gray 1997, p. 192), where |abc| denotes a scalar triple product and rho is the radius of curvature.

The quantity 1/tau is called the radius of torsion and is denoted sigma or phi.
