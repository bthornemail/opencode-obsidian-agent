Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves
If two single-valued continuous functions kappa(s) (curvature) and tau(s) (torsion) are given for s>0, then there exists exactly one space curve, determined except for orientation and position in space (i.e., up to a Euclidean motion), where s is the arc length, kappa is the curvature, and tau is the torsion.
