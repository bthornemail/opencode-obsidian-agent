Osculating Plane
The plane spanned by the three points x(t), x(t+h_1), and x(t+h_2) on a curve as h_1,h_2->0. Let z be a point on the osculating plane, then

 [(z-x),x^',x^('')]=0, 
where [A,B,C] denotes the scalar triple product. The osculating plane passes through the tangent. The intersection of the osculating plane with the normal plane is known as the (principal) normal vector. The vectors T and N (tangent vector and normal vector) span the osculating plane.
