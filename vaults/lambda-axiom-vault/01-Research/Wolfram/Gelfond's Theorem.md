Gelfond's Theorem
Gelfond's theorem, also called the Gelfond-Schneider theorem, states that a^b is transcendental if

1. a is algebraic !=0,1 and

2. b is algebraic and irrational.

This provides a partial solution to the seventh of Hilbert's problems. It was proved independently by Gelfond (1934ab) and Schneider (1934ab).

This establishes the transcendence of Gelfond's constant e^pi (since (-1)^(-i)=(e^(ipi))^(-i)=e^pi) and the Gelfond-Schneider constant 2^(sqrt(2)).

Gelfond's theorem is implied by Schanuel's conjecture (Chow 1999).
