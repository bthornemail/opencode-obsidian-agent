The user's query describes the boundary operator  in the context of simplicial homology. This operator acts on an oriented -simplex  to produce an alternating sum of its -dimensional faces. The notation  represents the -simplex created by removing the vertex . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Definition of the boundary operator Let  be an oriented -simplex. The boundary operator  is defined by the formula:The operator is then extended linearly to act on any -chain, which is a formal sum of -simplices. [2, 6, 7, 8, 9]  
Examples for low-dimensional simplices • 1-simplex (an edge): For the 1-simplex , the formula gives the difference between its endpoints: 
• 2-simplex (a triangle): For the 2-simplex , the boundary is the alternating sum of its edges:Since the orientation of a simplex is important, we have . This means the boundary can also be written as , which intuitively represents traversing the edges of the triangle. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]  

Key property:  A fundamental property of the boundary operator is that applying it twice results in zero. That is, the boundary of a boundary is always zero. For instance, if you apply the boundary operator to the boundary of a triangle, the vertices cancel out:This property is crucial for defining homology groups. [2, 15, 16, 17, 18]

Boundary Operator
Each of the maps in a chain complex

 ...->C_(i+1)->^(d_(i+1))C_i->^(d_i)C_(i-1)->... 
is known as a boundary operator.
