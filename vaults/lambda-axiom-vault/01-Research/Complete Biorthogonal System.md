Complete Biorthogonal System
A set of functions {f_1(n,x),f_2(n,x)} is termed a complete biorthogonal system in the closed interval R if, they are biorthogonal, i.e.,

int_Rf_1(m,x)f_1(n,x)dx	=	c_mdelta_(mn)	
(1)
int_Rf_2(m,x)f_2(n,x)dx	=	d_mdelta_(mn)	
(2)
int_Rf_1(m,x)f_2(n,x)dx	=	0	
(3)
int_Rf_1(m,x)dx	=	0	
(4)
int_Rf_2(m,x)dx	=	0	
(5)
and complete.

A complete biorthogonal system has a very special type of generalized Fourier series. The prototypical example of a complete biorthogonal system is {sin(nx),cos(nx)}_(n=0)^infty over R=[-pi,pi], which can be used as a basis for constructing "the" Fourier series of an arbitrary function.
