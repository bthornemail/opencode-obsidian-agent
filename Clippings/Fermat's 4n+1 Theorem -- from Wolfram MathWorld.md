Fermat's theorem, sometimes called Fermat's two-square theorem or simply "Fermat's theorem," states that a [prime number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html) can be represented in an essentially unique manner (up to the order of [addends](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Addend.html)) in the form for integer and [iff](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Iff.html) or (which is a degenerate case with ). The theorem was stated by Fermat, but the first published proof was by Euler.

The first few primes which are 1 or 2 (mod 4) are 2, 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 53, 61,... (OEIS [A002313](http://oeis.org/A002313)) (with the only prime congruent to 2 mod 4 being 2). The numbers such that equal these primes are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (1, 6),... (OEIS [A002331](http://oeis.org/A002331) and [A002330](http://oeis.org/A002330)).

The theorem can be restated by letting

then all [relatively prime](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RelativelyPrime.html) solutions to the problem of representing for any [integer](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Integer.html) are achieved by means of successive applications of the [genus theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GenusTheorem.html) and [composition theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompositionTheorem.html).
