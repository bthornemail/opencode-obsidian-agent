If ![p](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/Inline1.svg) and ![q](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/Inline2.svg) are distinct [odd](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OddNumber.html) [primes](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html), then the quadratic reciprocity theorem states that the [congruences](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Congruence.html)

are both solvable or both unsolvable unless both ![p](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/Inline3.svg) and ![q](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/Inline4.svg) leave the remainder 3 when divided by 4 (in which case one of the [congruences](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Congruence.html) is solvable and the other is not). Written symbolically,

where

| ![ (p/q)={1   for x^2=p (mod q) solvable for x; -1   for x^2=p (mod q) not solvable for x ](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/NumberedEquation3.svg) | (3) |

is known as a [Legendre symbol](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendreSymbol.html).

Gauss called this result the "aureum theorema" (golden theorem).

Euler stated the theorem in 1783 without proof. Legendre was the first to publish a proof, but it was fallacious. In 1796, Gauss became the first to publish a correct proof (Nagell 1951, p.Â 144). The quadratic reciprocity theorem was Gauss's favorite theorem from [number theory](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberTheory.html), and he devised no fewer than eight different proofs of it over his lifetime.

The [genus theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GenusTheorem.html) states that the [Diophantine equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiophantineEquation.html)

can be solved for ![p](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/Inline5.svg) a [prime](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html) [iff](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Iff.html) ![p=1 (mod 4)](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/Inline6.svg) or ![p=2](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem/Inline7.svg).
