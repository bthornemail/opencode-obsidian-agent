It has [regular singular points](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularSingularPoint.html) at 0, 1, and . Every [second-order ordinary differential equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Second-OrderOrdinaryDifferentialEquation.html) with at most three [regular singular points](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularSingularPoint.html) can be transformed into the hypergeometric differential equation.
