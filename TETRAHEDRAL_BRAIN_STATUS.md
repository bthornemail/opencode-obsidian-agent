# Project Status: The Tetrahedral Shared Brain

**Version:** 6.0
**Date:** September 26, 2025

## 1. Overall Status

**MVP of V5+ "Agentic Vaults" Architecture Complete.**

The initial proof-of-concept has been successfully refactored into the new, robust V5+ architecture. The foundational milestone (MVP) is complete, establishing the core components and workflows for the entire system.

## 2. Completed Milestone: MVP

-   **Architectural Refactor**: The project is now a `pnpm` workspace monorepo with a clean separation of concerns between the `cli`, `server`, `agent-runtime`, `plugin`, and a shared `core` package.
-   **`opencode-vault` CLI**: A functional CLI now exists with `create` and `start` commands to manage the lifecycle of isolated agent vaults.
-   **`agent-runtime`**: Each vault has a dedicated background runtime that automatically processes notes into `TetraNodes` by watching the file system.
-   **Plugin as a Client**: The Obsidian plugin has been refactored to be a pure client, connecting to its local `agent-runtime` based on a per-vault configuration.
-   **Two-Way Sync**: A robust, event-driven sync system is in place. The plugin uses native Obsidian events for user changes, and the runtime uses a file watcher for external changes, ensuring all modifications are captured.

## 3. Next Steps

With the foundational infrastructure now stable, development will proceed to **Phase 2** of the new master plan. This phase focuses on integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and establishing the first true agent-driven workflows.
