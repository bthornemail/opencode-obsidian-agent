How can i design an ai workflow in tetrahedial trie configuration using json canvas specwe can use embeddings for vectorization of transactions using obsidian md api and canvas json and use a ruleset for nodes and edges how would we define it to keep everything relational.  The defualt nodes pure typescript functions for the 21 hibert axioms to use the 21 hibert axioms to make 21 length array as a proof of the data if the point is an embedding vector or transfrom matrix.  
  
  Okay but if we make each node a type interface function and parameters like how anonymous lisp functions are defined in quadrants then we can get an embedding of all 4 parts and either store a embedding as a centroid signature for the function or an embedding as the centroid results of the function then if we have all the same or at least 3 of the same embeddings for the function defitions the one different can explain the difference in the centroid embedding if we explictly make each quadrant of a node a part of building a pure function so that the node is also a pure function  
    
    But building a pure function in typescript would need the function, the type for the parameters, the interface to describe the function, and an object or map of the types to the parameters.   We can hash each of those and  then hash all of them to in the edge configration of a regular tetrahedron adjency matrix to make the centroid.  Then we can use the same centroid to see if a varaible has changed    
    
I want the centroid to be a hash able of the vertices hash like similar to making it like a merkle root     
How to interpret the table     
- **Rows/Columns**: Each row and column corresponds to one of the four vertices.    
- **Entries**:    
  - The "1" or "leaf hash" at the intersection of row     
V1cap V sub 1    
ùëâ1    
 and column     
V2cap V sub 2    
ùëâ2    
 means there is an edge connecting vertex     
V1cap V sub 1    
ùëâ1    
 and vertex     
V2cap V sub 2    
ùëâ2    
.    
  - The "0" or "self-same hash" at the intersection of row     
V1cap V sub 1    
ùëâ1    
 and column     
V1cap V sub 1    
ùëâ1    
 means there is no edge connecting a vertex to itself.    
    
    
- **Vertex Degree**: The sum of each row (or column) is 3, which is the degree of each vertex. This confirms that three edges meet at every vertex of the tetrahedron.  
  
I want the centroid to be the actually adjency matrix for the vertices so we can have a determinalistc way to generate a json canvas spec nodes and the vertex is a hash of the function (or quadrant component) and a edge is a a hash of the concatenation of the two vertex hashes it connects and a centroid is a regular tetrahedron 4√ó4 adjacency matrix of edge hashes (with zeros or self-hashes on the diagonal) of the nodes and hashes. the adjacency matrix itself is a deterministic ‚Äúsignature‚Äù of the node, so you can detect any discrete change in a vertex or edge by monitoring the matrix

We are trying to make each node like a rpc or message sending node or more like nural net here if one vertice change the centroid moves based on the result of the function being another centrorid comparable to the first using typescript Generics for the node‚Äôs inputs and outputs can vary (numbers, vectors, embeddings, objects).Using generics ensures that the function signature and parameter types are explicit. It also makes hashing/embedding deterministic for the quadrants.  
  
  the self dual and dual polyhedron relatiomships of the platonic solids relate to this if the nodes original state represnation is the original shape and the inverse dual of the shape is the hash of the nodes verticies, edges cause i think the faces can stay the same in original and dual representation so we can use it for collaborative computation or consensus systems and data vericatiom ledger trie making each node like a tracable rumsfeld quandrant in a projective geometry hilbert space if we store faces as patrtica tries we can simulate faces as light cones for a historical log
  
  we could use ethers hdwallets or i think bip32 or even sepk256 to genertate hd paths for addressing we can add predtiction to it  
    
    Would i be able to make a distributed tetrahedial graph with using, a wallet address, a node generics type interface, a peer id or passkey,the shared trie of default nodes and the socket server connections as the edges betewwen them as the graph uri we can use it for separatley logging comnections withere local or remote as a separeate dht like hibert space in bipartite for the tetrahdrisl node projections.  We could map and trace online or offline transactioms through incidence updates.        
        
 Would that enable a separate URI ledger but relatinal to the CID ledger that 2 or more peers csn refeerence as a bsse for geometric consensus we can use as a broker, or server or even embedded oracle.              
            
I think if we give the sharable subgraphs the hd wallets, sockets, and peeridor passkeys, and protocol schema instad of each node then we can abstract that separte but equal and share subgraphs like private protected or public networks with their own protocols and schema but with only using pub sub simple as quic in the nodes to save data and bandwith becase we can track discreet phase changes like blockchain transactions with our reference trie

I thought we could you the full workspace and transactions api of the obsdian md vault api to write a obsidian plugin with the json canvas spec to build automous ai agent to peer pipelines like a view into the brain in an obsidian collabrative environment with notes being different shared tethrahedrial face views of the obsidian vault agent and the canvas being the inverse dual connections and data definitions uising the file,group,link or text types
