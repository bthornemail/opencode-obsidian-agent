Would i be able to make a distributed tetrahedial graph with using, a wallet address, a node generics type interface, a peer id or passkey,the shared trie of default nodes and the socket server connections as the edges betewwen them as the graph uri we can use it for separatley logging comnections withere local or remote as a separeate dht like hibert space in bipartite for the tetrahdrisl node projections. We could map and trace online or offline transactioms through incidence updates.



Would that enable a separate URI ledger but relatinal to the CID ledger that 2 or more peers csn refeerence as a bsse for geometric consensus we can use as a broker, or server or even embedded oracle.



I think if we give the sharable subgraphs the hd wallets, sockets, and peeridor passkeys, and protocol schema instad of each node then we can abstract that separte but equal and share subgraphs like private protected or public networks with their own protocols and schema as org-mode syntax but with only using pub sub for simple as quic in the nodes to save data and bandwith becase we can track discreet phase changes like blockchain transactions with our org-syntax or obsidian workspace api reference tries

As a way to automate the interactioms between model context protocol agents, ollama llms, peers and people with an epestemic topolology we can also pair it with winknlp and wordnet to give the users and autonomus agents a way to tag highlight and link known and unknown kniwkedge and understanding with semantics though the obsidian api core tools for consumption and productions with large language models and transformer models

What should i consider in making intuitive way for a user to interface considering the multiple mthods afforded by obsidan api if we target mobile. I want to build a news wiki to find a shared truth in current events by adding a fourm and tracking changes and pub sub connections per page for a forum or function we can make a rss feeds for collabrative editing environmentts extendenjng the obsididan ecosystem for people an agents can share sub graphs of their vaults like in canvas files like sheafs amd storage

Wait we should be able to map or retuve tags in any page or template but aslo the emotion we highlight with winknlp or should we just use universal sentence encoder to with wordnet to find all related documents in vault or via qrcodes and webrtc webauth and coturn/turn and with mqtt for public and ws direct conntect for private propagation using https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinyneat
