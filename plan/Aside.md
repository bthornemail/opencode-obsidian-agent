# High-level architecture (summary)

* **Node (tetrahedron):** pure-function unit with 4 hashed vertices (V1..V4), 4×4 adjacency matrix (self-hashes on diagonal, edge hashes off-diagonal), static centroid = matrix hash, dynamic centroid = matrix + output hash.
* **Identity / address:** ethers/HDNode (BIP32) derived from centroid or vertex hashes; secp256k1 keys for signing.
* **Peer identity:** libp2p/peerId or a passkey derived from HD seed; optional long-term PKI.
* **Shared trie:** each face stores a Patricia trie (historical log/light cone); subgraphs constitute shared tries.
* **Edges / connectivity:** sockets (QUIC, WebRTC, or WebSocket) implement pub/sub channels; each logical connection maps to a graph edge/URI.
* **Network ledger URIs:** human/agent-accessible URIs that represent subgraphs / nodes (e.g., `geo://<chain>/<node-id>`), and optionally map to CIDs on IPFS/PLD for archival/immutable references.
* **Verification / consensus:** peers exchange dual adjacency matrices, Hilbert proof arrays (21-entry), signatures, and Merkle/Patricia proofs for updates; accept updates via deterministic validation rules and conflict resolution policies.

# Core concepts & mapping to your terms

* **Vertex** = hash of quadrant (function code, param types, interface, param values).
* **Edge** = hash(vertexA + vertexB).
* **Adjacency matrix** = 4×4 matrix of vertex self-hashes and edge hashes.
* **Static centroid** = hash(flatten(matrix)).
* **Dynamic centroid** = hash(flatten(matrix) + hash(output)).
* **Face** = triangle (three vertices + edges) → **Patricia trie** storing history/events for that face.
* **Subgraph** = collection of nodes + shared tries + protocol schema + group HD wallet seed; can be public/private.
* **Graph URI** = addressable identifier that resolves to node metadata, adjacency matrix, current centroid, and endpoints (sockets).

# Data model (TypeScript-like interface sketch)

```ts
type Hash = string; // e.g. hex sha256
type CID = string;  // optional IPFS CID

interface Vertex {
  id: string;            // V1..V4
  kind: "fn" | "types" | "iface" | "values";
  payloadRef: Hash | CID; // hash or CID of payload
  selfHash: Hash;        // hash(payloadRef)
}

interface TetraNode {
  nodeId: string;            // deterministic: e.g. centroid or derived address
  vertices: Vertex[];        // length 4
  adjacencyMatrix: Hash[][]; // 4x4 as strings
  staticCentroid: Hash;      // hash(flatten(matrix))
  dynamicCentroid?: Hash;    // changes after output
  lastOutputRef?: Hash|CID;  // hash/CID of output
  proof21?: number[];        // Hilbert 21-axiom proof or scores
  signatures?: Record<string, string>; // by peer address
  faces?: Record<string, CID>; // face id -> Patricia trie CID (history)
}
```

# Identity & addressing

* Use `ethers.utils.HDNode` to derive node addresses:

  * seed = `keccak256(flatten(vertexHashes))` or `staticCentroid`
  * path = e.g. `m/44'/60'/nodeType'/v1index/v2index` or `m/nodeType/<firstNbits>`
* Node wallet provides:

  * deterministic **address** (public id)
  * **private key** to sign outputs, centroids, proofs
* Peer identity:

  * Option A: `libp2p` PeerId derived from the same seed (good for P2P DHT)
  * Option B: simple shared passkey derived from a subpath for private subgraphs

---

# Graph URIs & CID ledger relationship

* Design canonical URIs for resources:

  * Node: `geo://<network>/<nodeAddress>`
  * Subgraph: `geo://<network>/subgraph/<subgraphId>`
  * Face trie: `geo://<network>/node/<nodeAddress>/face/<faceId>`
* Map to content-addressed storage (optional):

  * Node static snapshot → uploaded to IPFS → returns CID. URI may include CID: `geo://ipfs/<CID>`
* **Relation to CID ledger**:

  * The CID ledger (IPFS/CID) provides immutable snapshots you can reference when verifying historical states.
  * Your dynamic adjacency/centroid ledger is relational: peers store latest centroids, but reference CIDs for frozen states (anchoring).
* Two or more peers can reference the same CID(s) as the basis for geometric consensus; they compare dynamic centroid/signature/proof arrays against these CIDs and dual adjacency matrices.

---

# Shared subgraphs & privacy model

* Each subgraph has:

  * `subgraphId` and `subgraphSeed` (HD mnemonic/seed fragment)
  * schema + protocol metadata (message types, Hilbert rules thresholds)
  * access policy (public/private/permissioned)
* Subgraphs can be **shared** (public) or **shared privately** (encrypted OP returns, passkey-derived addresses).
* You can support:

  * **Public networks**: anyone can derive addresses, but only authorized signers can propose updates.
  * **Private networks**: peer access via passkeys; messages encrypted and endpoints restricted.

---

# Communication layer (edges mapped to sockets)

* **Edge = live connection** (socket) between two peers or client/server.
* Use **QUIC** (via `msquic`, `quic-go`, or `node-quic`) for low-latency, connection-oriented UDP with TLS and streams; alternative: WebRTC for browser clients.
* Each connection advertises:

  * peer address (wallet)
  * supported subgraphs & schemas
  * protocol version
* **Pub/Sub**:

  * For scalability, use pub/sub channels representing graph topics: `topic:subgraph:<id>` or `topic:node:<nodeAddress>`
  * Use libp2p pubsub, NATS, or lightweight in-process pubsub over QUIC streams.
* **Bandwidth saving**:

  * Send diffs: only edge/vertex hashes changed, compressed delta + proof + signature.
  * Compress Patricia trie deltas; use Merkle proofs to prove inclusion when required.

---

# Verification & consensus flow (typical update)

1. **Node owner executes function** → computes `output`, sets `lastOutputRef` (hash/CID).
2. Recompute `dynamicCentroid = hash(staticCentroid + hash(output))`.
3. Compute `proof21` (Hilbert validation) using node vertices + neighbors or historical context.
4. Sign `dynamicCentroid || proof21 || timestamp` with node wallet.
5. Broadcast `UpdateMessage` on subgraph topic:

   * `{ nodeAddress, staticCentroid, dynamicCentroid, lastOutputRef, proof21, signature, matrixSnapshotCID? }`
6. **Receiving peer**:

   * Verify signature via node address (ethers verify).
   * Validate `staticCentroid` by reconstructing adjacency matrix from known vertex hashes (or request vertex hashes via Merkle proof).
   * Validate `proof21` (recompute locally or sample key axioms).
   * If passes policy, accept update and append it to face tries (Patricia trie per face) and optionally pin snapshot to CID storage.
7. **Conflict / Divergence**:

   * If two conflicting updates appear, use deterministic conflict resolution (e.g., higher weight signature set, majority of peer validation, timestamp + deterministic tie-breaker, or a voting mechanism).
   * Optionally map to a small consensus protocol (PBFT variant, or CRDT reconciliation if operations commute).

---

# Patricia tries as faces & historical log

* Each face stores historical events as a Patricia trie keyed by `timestamp || dynamicCentroid` or by monotonically increasing sequence numbers.
* Trie root -> CID; peers can request inclusion proofs for verification.
* Because faces correspond to triangles/relationships, they naturally shard the history of a node across the 4 faces (triangular faces per tetrahedron). This gives partial views and compact proofs.

---

# Hilbert axioms & projection verification in the network

* Each node stores `proof21` (21-element boolean or 0..1 scores).
* Rules for acceptance:

  * Some axioms are local (between node vertices) — verify immediately.
  * Others require neighbor/past-state context — either request necessary data or accept if signed by a quorum.
* Use the `proof21` as a **relational fingerprint** for geometric consensus:

  * Peers can vote or score updates; thresholds per subgraph schema determine acceptance.

---

# Security considerations

* **Authentication**: nodes & peers sign messages with secp256k1 keys; addresses derived via HD.
* **Privacy**: subgraphs can require access via passkey / private keys; content encryption for private subgraphs.
* **Replay protection**: include nonces/timestamps in signed updates; faces store monotonically increasing sequence numbers.
* **DoS protection**: rate-limit updates, require stake/proof-of-work, or reputational costs in permissioned networks.
* **Tamper evidence**: adjacency matrix + centroid + signature + CID snapshots provide verifiable tamper evidence.

---

# Efficiency & bandwidth strategies

* **Delta/edge-only updates**: broadcast only changed rows/cols in adjacency matrix and new dynamic centroid.
* **Merkle/Patricia proofs**: request proofs on-demand rather than whole state.
* **Batching**: group multiple node updates per message.
* **QUIC streams + flow control**: efficient small messages and low latency.
* **Local caching & persistence**: store tries locally (SQLite/LMDB) and only fetch remote proofs when needed.

# How this relates to CID ledger & geometric consensus

* **CID ledger (IPFS)** = immutable snapshot store; good for archiving matrices or entire node states once accepted by consensus.
* **Relational geometric ledger** = live, relational reference system among peers using centroids and proof arrays for consensus.
* Both can co-exist:

  * Live updates propagate via pub/sub and are used for fast reasoning and light consensus.
  * Periodic checkpoints are pinned to IPFS as CID snapshots so peers can anchor trust to immutable state.
* Multiple peers referencing the same set of CIDs provides a common basis for geometric consensus.

---

# Practical implementation stack suggestions

* Language: **TypeScript / Node.js** (you already have TS experience)
* Crypto & wallets: **ethers.js** (HD wallets + signing)
* P2P + DHT: **libp2p** (PeerId, pubsub, DHT) or **Hyperswarm** alternatives
* Transport: **QUIC** (node-quic bindings) or **WebRTC** for browsers; fallback WebSockets
* Persistent storage: **LMDB**, **SQLite**, or **RocksDB** for local tries
* Tries: implement Patricia trie (JS libraries exist) with Merkle root -> CID mapping (ipfs-only for snapshots)
* Optional archival: **IPFS / IPFS cluster** for snapshot pinning
* Proof verification: local `VectorHilbert` module for proof21 checks and geometry ops

---

# Example next-step plan (concrete)

1. Implement TS `TetraNode` class:

   * vertex hashing, adjacency matrix builder, `staticCentroid`.
2. Add execution API:

   * `execute(inputs)` → produce outputRef, `dynamicCentroid`, sign, broadcast update.
3. Build a simple pub/sub over QUIC:

   * topics: `subgraph:<id>`, `node:<addr>`.
4. Implement Patricia tries per face and Merkle proof generation.
5. Implement `verifyUpdate` routine:

   * verify signature, optionally fetch missing vertex payloads, verify proof21 (subset axioms), accept or reject.
6. Add HD wallet integration:

   * derive node address, sign messages.
7. Build a minimal CLI/node peer and demo:

   * create subgraph, create nodes, change a vertex, observe centroid changes across peers.
8. Optional: integrate IPFS snapshot pinning for archival.

# Final notes on feasibility & properties

* This design combines **cryptographic determinism**, **geometric relational validation**, and **efficient P2P messaging** to provide a verifiable, auditable, and bandwidth-conscious distributed ledger of computational nodes.
* It supports **both online & offline transactions**: offline actions can be appended to face tries locally and later synced via Merkle proofs when peers reconnect.
* The approach is flexible: you can choose weaker or stronger consensus depending on trust assumptions (permissioned vs trustless).
